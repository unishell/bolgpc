# Philosophy & Calling

Traditionally, people have pursued the three imperishable achievements of virtue, deeds, and words, believing the highest value lies in establishing moral character first, then accomplishing good works, and finally leaving a legacy through speech—so that one’s influence endures for future generations. After spending seven formative years studying business, I embraced a vital principle: return on investment (ROI). Every day of our lives is an investment of 24 hours—have we considered its eternal return?

As missionary martyr Jim Elliot said, “He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.” Scripture teaches that only God, His Word, and human lives are truly everlasting. My lifelong calling is to invest in eternity by embodying, teaching, and translating biblical truth, and by discipling Chinese believers to become devoted followers of the living God.
