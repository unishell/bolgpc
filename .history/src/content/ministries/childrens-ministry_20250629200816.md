## Sermon Overview

Jesus calls us to "walk by faith, not by sight," trusting fully in Him even when circumstances are uncertain. Today's message reminds us that true spiritual life is found in pressing on steadfastly in what we cannot see.

### 1. The Call to Faith

1. **The Reality of the Unseen**

   * "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." (Hebrews 11:1)
   * Trust God’s promises even when they aren’t visible.
2. **Letting Go of Control**

   * Peter walking on the water (Matthew 14:28–31)
   * The battle between faith and fear.
3. **Hearing His Voice**

   * Cultivating stillness in prayer to discern God’s direction.
   * Filtering out distractions to focus on His guidance.

### 2. The Power of Obedience

1. **Taking the First Step**

   * Stepping out even when we don’t know the outcome.
2. **Overcoming Doubt**

   * Choosing obedience amid uncertainty opens the door for God to work.
3. **Witnessing Miracles**

   * Faith and obedience together often result in the miraculous.

### 3. Daily Practices of Faith

* **In Prayer**: Replace anxiety with expectancy, trusting God’s response.
* **In Service**: The more we give, the more we experience His grace.
* **In Trials**: Lean on His promises rather than be defined by circumstances.
* **In Fellowship**: Encourage one another to build collective faith.

### Challenge for the Week

Identify one area where you’ve been hesitant—whether at work, at home, or in relationships—and take a step of faith this week without yielding to fear or opinions. Experience the power of God’s presence.

*This message sets the tone for our upcoming “Faith & Fellowship” gathering on July 6, 2025.*
