# The Origin of Prison Evangelism in Taiwan

In 2000, our choir at Evangelical Formosa Church of Irvine (EFC Irvine), having sung together for many years, had cultivated a very close fellowship and united spirit. I felt God impressing upon me that it was time to expand our choir ministry beyond Sunday offertory. We began to record Taiwanese gospel songs and distribute tapes and CDs to those in need, blessing them with uplifting gospel music. Over three consecutive years, we produced three CDs of Taiwanese gospel songs. In 2001, we performed our first musical, **No Greater Love**, with our choir members. By the end of 2005, our choir sensed God calling us to launch an evangelism ministry in Taiwan.

## Beginning a New Ministry

By the providence of our Lord, I was introduced to Teacher Chen Shu-Lan, then President of the Association of Tainan Prisons and Rehabilitative Care. She helped open the doors for Taiwan Prisons Ministry (TPM). As we planned, the list of tasks grew exponentially—designing choir uniforms, booking airline tickets, arranging transportation and lodging in Taiwan, and coordinating which prisons would welcome our ministry. Stepping into this new venture, I had no clear roadmap, but the Lord graciously led us step by step, overcoming obstacles and enabling a smooth launch.

In 2006, Teacher Chen coordinated with prison administrators across Taiwan to establish our visitation schedule. Working alongside choir members, we arranged flights and lodging near each facility. This successful beginning inspired our members to share testimonies with friends in Orange County and Los Angeles, growing our single team into four. Consequently, TPM reached more of the 50 prisons and rehabilitation centers throughout Taiwan.

## Serving Local Churches

Our ministry raised funds to donate pianos to prisons lacking instruments and established Christian chapels where none existed. We also performed in local churches during our visits, encouraging congregations and sharing how God blessed our TPM outreach in Taiwan’s prisons.

## The Heart of Ministry

Although we cannot free inmates from physical confinement, we bring God’s love and peace to their hearts. The Bible says, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” God’s love is extravagant and beyond human measure. His grace is offered freely to those willing to open their hearts—no payment or merit required.

This love transforms lives and brings new hope. A prison officer testified that our musicals and testimonies filled the facility with God’s love and unprecedented peace.

## All by God’s Grace

From our first trip in 2006 until 2019 (pre-COVID-19), God enabled us to present His love through music in Taiwan’s prisons. We rejoice in the inmates’ positive responses and the many who decided to follow Jesus. Prison life is difficult and routine, often leaving released inmates vulnerable to old habits. Our prayer is to offer them lasting hope and change through Christ.
