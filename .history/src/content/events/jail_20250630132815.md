# Seminary Features

1. **Mentorship Model**
   We employ a mentor‑apprentice system that focuses on five core areas: character, truth, service, relationships, and anointing. BOLTS partners with local church pastors to guide students’ spiritual growth, ministry development, and relational maturity.

2. **High‑Tech Connectivity**
   Through a blend of on‑site education and online platforms, we equip future ministers with the digital skills and theological foundations needed by 21st‑century churches.

3. **Flexible Study Environment**
   Students can continue serving in their home churches without relocating or resigning from their jobs, all while remaining under spiritual oversight and building upon their existing ministry context.

4. **Annual Spiritual Intensive**
   Once a year, all students gather at the main campus for a week‑long spiritual retreat featuring intensive courses, vision casting, and times of anointing.
