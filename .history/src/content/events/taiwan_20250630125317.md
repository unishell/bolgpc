# Advent Missions Organization

**Established in 2005 and formally named Advent in 2008**, the Advent missions organization seeks to share the good news of the Gospel with students of English around the world. Our strategy integrates a conversation-based English curriculum with Gospel themes—encouraging both faithful living according to Biblical principles and introducing students to the person of Jesus Christ.

## A Letter from the President of Advent Taiwan

It was about forty years ago that many young and talented students from Taiwan came abroad for graduate study, most landing in the United States. Their studies led them into various disciplines and eventual settlement across the country. Though now citizens of this new world, their hearts have remained with their motherland, Taiwan, yearning to contribute to the land where they grew up.

四十年前，許多年輕學子到海外留學，其中大部分留在美國成家立業。雖然他們已經成為這新世界的公民，但他們的心仍歸向祖國──台灣，也願意為成長之地盡一份心力。

The second generation of these settlers has come of age, most born and raised in the United States and now enrolled or about to enroll in universities. Beginning in 2002, Taiwan prepared to join the WTO and designated English as a semi-official language. We view this as an opportunity both to serve Taiwan’s progress and to help the second generation understand their parents’ cultural roots.

這些移居者的第二代已逐漸長大，多半出生於美國，現為大學生或即將進入大學的新鮮人。自2002年起，台灣為加入WTO將英文列為半官方語言。我們將此視作回饋家鄉的良機，也讓第二代更了解父母成長的背景。

For more than four years, we have organized annual English camps for Taiwanese students. Each summer, around sixty college and high-school–age volunteers prepare lesson plans, dramas, games, and songs to teach English and share the Gospel.

這也是為何四年以來，我們持續舉辦英文營，服事台灣中小學生。每年三月，六十餘名志願者預備教學計畫、話劇、遊戲與歌唱，既教英文，也分享福音。

The program is called **ADVENT**: “VENT” stands for *Volunteer ENglish Teachers*, and “AD” signifies “After the Days of Christ.” Our teaching coordinator is Daniel Chang, a pre-med graduate from Berkeley, and many of our volunteers come from top U.S. universities with exemplary character. They spend three weeks in Taiwan as part of this rich cultural exchange.

我們稱此計畫為**ADVENT**，VENT代表“Volunteer ENglish Teachers”，AD則寓意“After Days（紀元後）”。本次教學協調員為加州柏克萊大學醫學預科生Daniel Chang，其他志工亦多來自優秀學府，品格俱佳。他們在台灣度過三週，進行文化交流與福音分享。

As for me, a 1974 civil engineering graduate of National Taiwan University, I have since earned three master’s degrees (in structural engineering and theology) and a PhD in theology. I am responsible for organizing and overseeing each Advent Taiwan trip.

我本人於1974年畢業於台灣大學土木系，後取得結構工程與神學三碩士以及神學博士學位。自始，我負責策劃與統籌每次Advent Taiwan行程。

I hope this background information is helpful for your consideration.

願此介紹能助您更了解Advent Taiwan。

**Respectfully yours,**
Dr. Yue‑Ming Joseph Chang
張玉明牧師敬上
