# Advent Missions Organization

**Established in 2005 and formally named Advent in 2008**, the Advent missions organization seeks to share the good news of the Gospel with students of English around the world. Our strategy integrates a conversation-based English curriculum with Gospel themes—encouraging faithful living according to Biblical principles and introducing students to the person of Jesus Christ.

## A Letter from the President of Advent Taiwan

About forty years ago, many young and talented Taiwanese students came abroad for graduate study, most settling in the United States. Their academic pursuits led them into various disciplines and eventually to make the U.S. their home. Though now citizens of this new world, their hearts have remained with their motherland, Taiwan, yearning to give back to the land where they grew up.

The second generation of these settlers has come of age—many born and raised in the United States and now pursuing university degrees. In 2002, Taiwan prepared to join the WTO and designated English as a semi-official language. We view this as both an opportunity to serve Taiwan’s progress and a chance for the second generation to understand their parents’ cultural roots.

For over four years, we have organized annual English camps for Taiwanese students. Each summer, around sixty college and high-school–age volunteers prepare lesson plans, dramas, games, and songs to teach English and share the Gospel.

The program is called **ADVENT**: “VENT” stands for *Volunteer ENglish Teachers*, and “AD” signifies “After the Days of Christ.” Our teaching coordinator is Daniel Chang, a pre-med graduate from Berkeley, and many of our volunteers come from top U.S. universities with exemplary character. They spend three weeks in Taiwan as part of a rich cultural exchange.

I am a 1974 civil engineering graduate of National Taiwan University. Since then, I have earned three master’s degrees (in structural engineering and theology) and a PhD in theology. I oversee and coordinate each Advent Taiwan trip.

I hope this background information is helpful for your consideration.

**Respectfully yours,**
Dr. Yue‑Ming Joseph Chang
